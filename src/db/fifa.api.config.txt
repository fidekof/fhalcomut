It's not part of the toolkit so far. Feel free to contribute a PR :)
You can use these kind of requests out of your project:
https://www.easports.com/de/fifa/ultimate-team/api/fut/item?jsonParamObject=%7B%22baseid%22:%2220801%22,%22link%22:1%7D
or
https://www.easports.com/de/fifa/ultimate-team/api/fut/price-band/20801
or
https://www.easports.com/de/fifa/ultimate-team/api/fut/item?jsonParamObject=%7B%22ovr%22:%2274:99%22,%22pageSize%22:40,%22position%22:%22LW%22%7D

Just use Fiddler and open FUT DB - Then you can inspect all the requests you need for your project.

For the existing transactions (playerimage, nationimage, etc.) I updated to FUT18 here:
